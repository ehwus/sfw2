        PROPOSALS FOR CHANGE
      </h3>
      <article className="lg:p-24 flex flex-col gap-5 m-5">
        <p>
          <b>Implement an amnesty from arrest</b> to protect sex workers who
          report witnessing or experiencing violence. A sex worker-led campaign
          won such an amnesty in California. In cities across the US (Baltimore,
          Los Angeles, Manhattan, Philadelphia, San Francisco) District
          Attorneys are refusing to prosecute sex workers in recognition of the
          harm caused by criminalisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Amend National Police Chiefs’ Council guidelines</b> to specify
          that arrests and raids should only occur where police can show
          reasonable grounds to suspect that sex workers are being subject to
          force and coercion. This would help ensure that sex workers aren’t
          criminalised “simply for being sex workers” or engaging in practices
          that increase their own safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            Instruct the police, prosecuting authorities and courts to
            prioritise safety
          </b>{" "}
          by vigorously investigating and prosecuting rape, coercion, stalking
          and other violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            Target resources at sex workers to enable them to leave prostitution
            if they choose.
          </b>{" "}
          Specifically, priority for social housing, debt relief, health
          services, improved domestic violence services and instructing benefit
          decision makers to not impose sanctions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Extend to mothers as a “care income”</b>, the recently announced
          payment of £1600 a month for young people leaving care in recognition
          of the fact that most sex workers are working to support families.
          Hawaii passed a law in January to pay a basic income of $2000 a month
          to sex workers aiming to exit prostitution.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            Take action to stop sex working mothers losing custody of their
            children
          </b>{" "}
          -- no child should be is taken from their mother/primary carer because
          the family is poor, homeless or unable to afford food, clothing or
          childcare.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Scrap the No Recourse to Public Funds (NRPF) condition</b> which
          disproportionately affects women and leaves them destitute and at risk
          of exploitation and violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            Implement a &apos;firewall&apos; to separate police investigations
            and labour inspections from Immigration Enforcement
          </b>
          , to ensure migrant sex workers can report violence regardless of
          their immigration status
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            Oppose Clause 16 (Schedule 7 – Priority Offences) of the Online
            Safety Bill
          </b>{" "}
          which will effectively prevent sex workers advertising online as this
          has been shown to increase the risks for sex workers and make it
          harder to work independently.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Oppose the criminalisation of sex workers’ clients</b> (so called
          ‘Nordic model’) as this undermines sex workers’ safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            Support demands nationally for the decriminalisation of sex work.
          </b>{" "}
          Evidence from New Zealand where decriminalisation was introduced in
          2003 shows: no rise in prostitution; women more able to report
          violence without fear of arrest; attacks cleared up more quickly; sex
          workers more able to leave prostitution as convictions are cleared
          from their records; drug users treated as patients not criminals.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an immediate first step, the 2016 parliamentary Home Affairs
          Committee recommendation could be implemented to decriminalise sex
          workers on the street and working together in premises and expunge
          criminal records.
