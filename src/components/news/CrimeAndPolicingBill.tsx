        concentrated in Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. Nationally, the majority

        The English Collective of Prostitutes have shown that sex work is
        increasing because poverty is increasing. In Wales, almost a quarter of
        people are living in poverty with women disproportionately affected.
        Wales now has the worst child poverty rate of all the UK nations, with
        31% of children living below the poverty line. But rather than focusing

        to repeal the offence of “loitering or soliciting for the purposes of
        prostitution”. This has long been called for by sex workers. But it
        appears to be a concession that masks a series of further amendments
        that would function to collectively harm sex workers.

      <p className="text-justify">
        Clause NC2 targets so-called third parties. Its broad definition means
        anyone who associates with a sex worker could be prosecuted for
        commercial sexual exploitation. This clause would also criminalise
        advertising sites which sex workers depend on to work independently and
        in greater safety.

        Clause NC3 criminalises clients by making it illegal to pay for or
        provide any benefit in exchange for sexual services. Its backers argue
