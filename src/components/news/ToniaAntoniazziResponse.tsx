        A response to Tonia Antoniazzi MPs parliamentary statement
      </h4>
      <h5 className="italic">3 July 2025</h5>

      <p className="text-justify">
        On June 18th Tonia Antoniazzi MP addressed parliament to discuss her proposed amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. We welcome her work to decriminalise abortion and efforts to repeal the offence of "loitering or soliciting for the purposes of prostitution". But we are not distracted from other elements of her ongoing political work that would increase violence against sex workers — especially those who are intersectionally stigmatised, including migrants, trans and disabled workers.

      <p className="text-justify">
        The language that Tonia Antoniazzi MPs uses is inflammatory and misleading. In Parliament she insisted that women who use websites to advertise their services and screen clients for safety are part of a 'supercharg[ed] sex trafficking trade'. This is irresponsible and inaccurate. Extensive operations by police forces across the UK have failed to produce evidence that would support this statement.

      <p className="text-justify">
        Tonia Antoniazzi MP also spoke of 'online mega-brothels' driven by the demand of clients. Sex workers - especially women and single mothers - have spoken out time and again to emphasise that poverty and precarity underpin sex work. Even a 2019 Work and Pensions Committee Inquiry found that women are driven to survival sex work due caps on Universal Credit. But Tonia Antoniazzi MP voted in favour of keeping the two child cap on Universal Credit when given an opportunity to abolish it in July last year! On that very same day, she spoke in parliament about the need to "protect women and girls".

      <p className="text-justify">
        This week, along with Swansea East's Carolyn Harris MP, Tonia Antoniazzi MP voted with the government in favour of a £2 billion cut to the Universal Credit health element hitting 750,000 new claimants.
      </p>

      <p className="text-justify">
        We are calling out this hypocrisy. Both Tonia Antoniazzi MP and Carolyn Harris MP are consistently working to implement policies that have been demonstrated to increase violence against sex workers. Research by Amnesty International found that the 2017 introduction of laws that criminalise clients in Northern Ireland has had a 'chilling effect' on the human rights of sex workers. Tonia Antoniazzi MP described this model as 'excellent practice'.
      </p>

      <p className="text-justify">
        We reject Welsh MPs consistent misrepresentation of the social and economic realities that surround participation in sex work. Acknowledging that poverty and precarity underpin sex work is not glamorising prostitution. Our effort should be on targeting resources to women to empower them to refuse prostitution if they choose. Our MPs should not be advocating for policies that have been demonstrated to increase violence against our communities.
