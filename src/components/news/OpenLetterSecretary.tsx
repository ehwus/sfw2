        <p className="text-justify font-medium mb-4">
          Dear Secretary of State,
        </p>

        <p className="text-justify mb-4">
          We are writing to you as a group of sex workers' rights and wider civil society organisations, to ask you to take urgent action to prevent increasing numbers of women being driven into sex work by poverty and financial need.
        </p>

        <p className="text-justify mb-4">
          Women and children disproportionately bear the brunt of the current poverty crisis, faced with a huge rise in living costs, low wages, and over a decade of harsh benefit cuts. Unacceptably, in 2025, 18% of UK children now live in households experiencing food poverty. The Government's upcoming Child Poverty Strategy presents a huge opportunity to tackle this staggeringly high level of child poverty, but the evidence must not be ignored: to lift children out of poverty, we must also lift women out of poverty.
        </p>

        <p className="text-justify mb-4">
          At this time, UK sex worker charities and advocacy groups are witnessing increasing numbers of women entering the industry for the first time out of financial necessity. There are a range of different reasons why people go into sex work to support themselves. However, Decrim Now's recent survey of 172 sex workers paints a bleak picture, finding that 76% started sex work due to financial need. 77% of respondents considered themselves to be disabled or to have a long-term health condition, and many sex workers highlighted their health or disability as a key reason why they went into sex work.
        </p>

        <p className="text-justify mb-4">
          Our survey additionally found that 53% of respondents were working multiple jobs outside of sex work, and 27% had caring responsibilities, predominantly for children or a family member. Alarmingly, we are seeing more students enter the industry, as well as older women who are increasingly entering or re-entering the industry later in life due to financial pressures. We know that many migrant women go into sex work to support themselves because they have limited or no access to public funds, even when destitute. Women are also more likely to be trapped in abusive relationships if they cannot afford to leave, and some women use sex work to enable themselves to escape abuse.
        </p>

        <p className="text-justify mb-4">
          Social security is the cornerstone of our human rights, such as housing, food and health. Clearly our social security system must be reformed to ensure people have the financial support they need to afford the essentials, without having to rely on sex work if they don't want to.
        </p>

        <p className="text-justify mb-4">
          Whilst people of any gender (and no gender) can and do go into sex work, the majority of sex workers are women and many are mothers. Due to current laws, these women, driven by poverty, are then forced to work in unsafe conditions, facing violence, stigma and discrimination. This must end.
        </p>

        <p className="text-justify mb-4">
          The laws around sex work can be contentious, and the undersigned may differ in our views about which legislative models lead to the greatest safety for women. Despite this, we are united in our concern about women's poverty, and the wellbeing of those who feel they have no choice but to enter sex work in order to survive.
        </p>

        <p className="text-justify mb-4">
          The Government has promised to reduce child poverty by the end of this parliament. In order to achieve this moral imperative and prevent more women entering sex work due to poverty, we urge you to use your Autumn Budget to implement the following changes:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>Increase Universal Credit to a level that meets people's essential needs</li>
          <li>Scrap the no recourse to public funds condition</li>
          <li>Scrap the two child limit on benefits</li>
          <li>Lift the benefit cap</li>
          <li>Stop cuts to disability and health benefits</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-justify mb-4">
          We know that there is enough money in the UK to fund these changes - the Government simply has to make the political decisions required to find it, such as by exploring the options for better taxing and redistributing wealth. As more women find themselves without the money to pay their rent or to feed their children, we can't afford not to make these changes.
        </p>

        <p className="text-justify mb-4">
          As one sex worker responded to our survey's final question, which asked what they would like to tell the Government about their experiences: "People do sex work because they need money. If you want to live in a society where women aren't reliant on selling sex, it's poverty we need to tackle."
        </p>

        <p className="text-justify font-medium mb-4">
          Yours sincerely,
        </p>
