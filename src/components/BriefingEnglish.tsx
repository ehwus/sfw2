          Issued by: Safety First Wales (SFW) – a coalition of sex workers,
          health professionals, church representatives, anti-poverty,
          anti-violence, and trans rights campaigners -- formed to decriminalise
          sex work in Wales and prioritise sex workers’ safety, health, and
          well-being.

        <p className="text-justify">
          This report includes testimony from sex workers who either a) attended
          the first meeting of SFW, b) participated in research conducted by
          Swansea University or c) are part of the network of the English

        <h5 className="font-bold italic">CURRENT SITUATION</h5>
        <p className="text-justify">
          There are approximately 72,800 sex workers in the UK. In Wales it is
          estimated that there are at least 2471 sex workers. This includes 1195
          sex workers working online, 912 working in brothels/massage parlours
          and up to 263 working on the street. These figures are from 2014 so it
          is likely that the numbers are now substantially higher.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Sex work is identified in all 22 local authority areas of Wales and is
          most concentrated in Cardiff, Newport and Swansea.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Nationally, the majority of sex workers are women (85-90%), most of
          whom are mothers working to support families.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-bold italic">POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS</h5>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Prostitution is increasing throughout the UK because poverty is
          increasing. Colossal rises in energy bills, food and other essential
          expenses are causing hunger, homelessness, rising debt and terrible
          suffering. For decades austerity cuts have targeted women. Benefit
          sanctions, already found to be a primary cause of the increase in
          street prostitution, are being expanded and made even more harsh. Cuts
          in disability benefits and services have pushed disabled women in
          particular into sex work.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          In Wales, even before the Covid-19 pandemic, almost a quarter of
          people were living in poverty with women disproportionately affected.
          Wales now has the worst child poverty rate of all the UK nations, with
          31% of children living below the poverty line.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Welsh MP Liz Saville Roberts, along with others, tabled questions to
          the government about the lack of financial support for sex workers
          during the Covid-19 pandemic and asked for emergency payments for sex
          workers in crisis. The heartless government response was that people
          should apply for Universal Credit, ignoring evidence from a
          parliamentary committee that draconian benefit regulations were
          pushing women, particularly single mothers, into “survival sex”.
          Measures in Wales to mitigate poverty like payments to children
          eligible for free school meals are welcome but don’t meet the need.
          Migrant women who have No Recourse to Public Funds are left destitute
          and vulnerable to exploitation and violence and this pushes women into
          sex work to survive.

          These quotes show how sex work in Wales is often underpinned by
          precarious financial and housing situations. They demonstrate why it
          is so important that sex work is recognised in a broader context of
          poverty and homelessness. Inadequate benefits provision, housing and
          employment opportunities can mean individuals are reliant on sex work
          to generate income and avoid destitution and homelessness for
          themselves and their families.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-bold italic">CRIMINALISATION AND POLICING</h5>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Under the prostitution laws hundreds of sex workers in the UK are
          threatened with arrest, raided, prosecuted, and even imprisoned each
          year for working on the street or for working with others in premises,
          with migrant, trans and women of colour being disproportionately
          targeted. For migrant women with insecure immigration status the
          effect of criminalisation is compounded by fear of deportation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Sex workers in Wales report diverse experiences and perceptions of
          policing, as well as the harmful consequences of being subjected to
          prostitution laws. The legacies of police operations, such as
          Operation Pentameter in 2006, and more recent targeting of sex workers
          in Swansea and Newport, trigger fear and distrust of the police and
          undermine the possibility of the police offering protection and
          support to sex workers.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          It is clear within the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) Policing
          Sex Work Guidance, that raiding and arresting sex workers for
          prostitution related offences is contradictory to good policing
          practice. The guidance clearly states that the safety of people
          engaged in sex work must be paramount. Yet sex workers remain the
          subject of extensive police attention in certain areas of Wales. For
          instance, in Swansea the police have enforced soliciting offences
          against street-based sex workers who do not engage with support
          services whilst Newport council criminalised sex workers with the
          reintroduction of Public Space Protection Orders for ‘sexual
          exploitation’. This led, in April 2022, to 50 people being arrested,
          and 40 charged, during an operation relating to street sex work.
          Recent reports of “racism, misogyny and bigotry” in Gwent police has
          also undermined public trust.

        <p className="text-justify">
          Sex workers have described how fines and criminal records trap them in
          prostitution. Trans sex workers in Wales spoke about police
          surveillance and being investigated for trying to help others. Sex
          workers described the impact of the laws:

          These quotes reveal the different forms that sex workers’ interactions
          with the police can take. They draw attention to the violence that can
          be experienced by sex workers at the hands of the police. Little
          research had been done on this until a 2022 study of 197 sex workers
          in East London which found that 42% of street workers had suffered
          violence from the police.
        </p>
        <p className="justify-text">
          Additionally, these quotes demonstrate how the identification of
          individuals as sex workers by the police can prevent them from
          accessing jobs in other areas of the labour market, leading to a
          further reliance on sex work to generate income.
        </p>
        <p className="justify-text">
          Current legislation and law related to sex work and prostitution
          simply do not work and calls to increase the criminalisation of sex
          work by criminalising sex workers clients must be opposed because it
          undermines safety. In countries where this kind of law, known as the
          Nordic Model, has been implemented, sex workers’ face increased
          stigma, are more at risk of violence are less able to call on the
          protection of the police and the authorities, have faced evictions,
          and are more likely to have their children taken into care. Despite
          claims that the law has led to a decline in prostitution, there is no
          actual evidence of this.
        </p>
        <p className="justify-text">
          The decriminalisation of sex work is rooted in the principles of
          promoting safety, reducing harm and enhancing the well-being of those
          engaged in sex work. Decriminalisation, is supported not only by sex
          workers themselves, but also by prestigious organisations such as the
          Royal College of Nursing, Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants,
          Freedom United, Women Against Rape in the UK and internationally
          Amnesty International, the World Health Organization, Human Rights
          Watch, UNAIDS, International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and
          Intersex Association, Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women.
        </p>
        <h5 className="font-bold italic">VIOLENCE</h5>
        <p className="justify-text">
          Sex workers face high levels of violence, and criminalisation
          exacerbates the harms sex workers suffer. A report from Swansea
          University’s Centre for Criminology and Criminal Justice shows
          shocking levels of violence experienced by street-based sex workers in
          Cardiff.
        </p>
        <p className="justify-text">
          It is much safer for sex workers to work indoors and with others but,
          under brothel keeping laws, it is illegal. Research shows that where
          arrests of sex workers and clients were high, fewer women report
          violence. When women do report violence, they often face prosecution
          for sex work while little is done to catch their attackers.
        </p>
        <p className="justify-text">
          When police prioritise prosecution over protection violent men are
          given impunity to attack again. Women Against Rape point to the fact
          that rape has been effectively decriminalised. Prosecutions for
          reported rape are the lowest ever – 1.4%! Sex workers face added
          discrimination with only 25% of those suffering attacks reporting this
          to the police. This was confirmed by a national advisor on violence
          against women to the Welsh government who described how sex workers
          are reluctant to report rape and other violence to the police as they
          think that nothing will be done.

          SEX-WORKING MOTHERS’ EXPERIENCE OF SOCIAL SERVICES
        </h5>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Sex workers are frequently labelled bad mothers with the assumption
          that they are a risk to themselves and their children. This is
          exacerbated by the criminalisation of sex work which prevents sex
          working mums being public and getting credit and recognition for the
          hard work of raising children (in often difficult circumstances) and
          this vital contribution to society. Sex working mums are also more
          likely to have their children taken by social services and the family
          courts causing lifelong grief and trauma.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          More than one in 100 children in Wales are “looked after” by the state
          and the numbers are increasing at an even higher rate than England.
          Poverty is a factor along with discrimination by the family courts: in
          north Wales, 77% of all care applications resulted in a care order
          between 2010 and 2016 compared, for example, to 39% in west London.
          Research found that children of “Black Caribbean heritage are more
          likely than white British children to be in care, regardless of
          deprivation level” pointing to racism in the child welfare system.
          Children put in institutionalised care are more likely to suffer abuse
          than those that remain with their family.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Support Not Separation, a coalition to end the unwarranted separation
          of children from their mothers or other primary carers, is campaigning
          to change the definition of ‘neglect’ in the Children Act to prohibit
          children being taken from their mothers because of poverty. This
          follows a law change in California which states that children should
          not be separated from their families “based on conditions of financial
          difficulty, including, but not limited to, a lack of food, clothing,
          shelter or childcare…”

        <p className="text-justify">
          Proposals in Wales to remove profit from the provision of children’s

          Trafficking laws are used as a justification for police crackdowns on
          migrant sex workers for arrest and deportation and have distorted the
          public perception of how much prostitution is directly the result of
          trafficking. In fact, research found that less than 6% of MIGRANT sex
          workers had been trafficked; many said they preferred working in the
          sex industry rather than the “unrewarding and sometimes exploitative
          conditions they meet in non-sexual jobs”.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Trafficking is enabled by poverty and women’s determination to escape
          it as well as the hostile immigration environment that makes it
          impossible for most migrants, including asylum seekers and victims of
          gender-based violence, to cross international borders unaided.
          Traffickers escape prosecution not because of a lack of applicable
          laws, but as with domestic violence and rape, because protecting women
          is not the priority.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Evidence published by The Lancet, credible research institutions and
          practitioners indicates that there is no causal relationship between
          criminalisation of sex work and reduction in trafficking or sexual
          exploitation.

          Sex workers take good care of their health, but research has found
          criminalised sex workers were twice as likely to contract HIV or
          another sexually transmitted infection, and one-and-a-half times as
          likely to report having condom-less sex with a client.
          Decriminalisation could reduce new HIV transmissions by up to 46%

          Stigma, discrimination, and the criminalisation of sex work are major
          barriers for sex workers accessing appropriate health care. Sex
          workers often hide their involvement in sex work due to fear of being
          judged and discriminated against. When they do disclose their
          occupation, they often experience disapproval, shaming and questioning
          about their work in a sexualising and degrading manner. Sex workers
          also face structural barriers to accessing health care such as long
          waits, restrictive hours, unwelcoming spaces, fear of arrest, legal
          status requirements, inconvenient location, lack of transportation,
          inability to pay and lack of confidentiality.

          When asked, sex workers in Wales described that they wanted
          “consistency”, more flexible appointments and health workers, and “a
          community feel; being able to come to a service and talk and chat as
          yourself and openly and not being judged.”

        <p className="text-justify">
          The focus on policing as a way to reduce sex work has distorted
          priorities so that money goes to law enforcement rather than provision
          of benefits, housing and other resources for women to enable and
          empower women to leave and refuse prostitution. University of Swansea
          research found that: “[…] it is a focus on experiences of victims of
          sexual exploitation, domestic abuse and modern slavery that are used
          to inform the development of sex work service provision, whilst
          disregarding the requests of sex workers for decriminalisation,
          self-determination, labour rights and safety.”
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Barriers to accessing resources are heightened by lack of
          identification documents particularly for trans and migrant sex
          workers. It affects every area of people’s lives including access to
          housing, benefits and health care.
